Statically Typed  vs.  Non-Statically Typed Languages
-----------------------------------------------------

Statically Typed Languages
--------------------------

1. type of a variable is known at compile time.
2. Variables must be explicitly declared with a type (e.g., int, string, boolean).
3. Type checking is done before execution, reducing runtime errors.
4. Examples: Java, C, C++, Kotlin, Swift, TypeScript



Non-Statically Typed (Dynamically Typed) Languages
--------------------------------------------------

1. The type of a variable is determined at runtime.
2. No need to explicitly declare types; the language assigns types dynamically.
3. Can lead to unexpected type errors during execution.
4. Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP


JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning:
----------------------------------------------------

=> Variables are not bound to a specific type.
=> You can assign different types of values to the same variable at different times.
